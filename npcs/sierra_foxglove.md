## Description
Sierra Foxglove is a female tauric spiderfox that functions as a nurse that roams the Infinite Library. If she cannot assist the injured party in the field, she will use her own silk as a binding tool to lash the injured to her abdomen so she can quickly make a run for it. The library has many dangers and she's familiar with lots of them. She wears a set of blue scrubs on her fox half and on her spider half she has had a specially made durable canvas covering created to protect her abdomen and make any impromptu rides on the 8-legged express (a nickname she hates) a bit more comfortable. 

The canvas cover has large d-rings and straps to further secure the injured party to prevent further injury. Her silk has a latent antiseptic effect and appears to also have some form of minor healing magic, though this does fade as it dries. Once dried, it has the tensile strength of steel, but can be cut easily. Through training she can manipulate how the silk is pulled, causing it either form thin like a sheet roughly 6 inches in width or compress like a rope.

### Behavior

While not known for the greatest bedside manner, Sierra is efficient, unflappable, and surprisingly warm under pressure. She doesnâ€™t tolerate nonsense during triage, but will offer a lollipop or an insult after. Her presence is often preceded by the sound of eight-legged footfalls and the snap of silk being drawn. She is aware how important her job is and does it with pride. When not on duty, she can be found in the Manga section of the Infinite Library, reading the latest issue of "I Reincarnated And All I Got Was Slime". Bookmoths tend to hitch a ride on Sierra when she strides through the Infinite Library, especially Medimoths and Tutorwings, which can be detrimental when she is working in the field.
