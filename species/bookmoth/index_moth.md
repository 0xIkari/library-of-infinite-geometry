## Description

The Index Moth (*Indexus Regulata*) is a large moth with a 14 inch wingspan and an 8 inch length, with a weight of 90 grams. Their body is oblong in shape and have two bushy antennae on their head. Their wingtips glow red when they beep. They are a communal creature that nest in large groups called Files. The Index Moth is primarily black and white with a wing pattern that presents as similar to a QR code, though it is unscannable. Their body has vertical black and white lines on it that resemble a barcode. Their eyes are an irridesent bluish green similar to dragonflies and studies have shown they can read a book spine at 20 paces. They have six legs that are slightly barbed to allow them to pull and reshelve books. In spite of its size, it has enough lift strength to "reshelve" a toddler.

### Quirks

The Index Moth has several unique quirks that separate it from other Moths of the Infinite Library. The most obvious is their vocalizations. This sound is very similar to the beep of a barcode scanner. Studies conducted by the Infinite Library's research department have not yielded the following reasons why they beep: when scared, when hungry, when reshelving a book, when finding a misshelved book, when flying, when trying to get someone's attention, when excited, when bored, and for no reason at all. The beep never varies in tone or length, so figuring out what the moth wants is an exercise left up to the reader.

In spite of being a bookmoth, Index Moths cannot speak Mothic Itteratta. They can however understand all languages, but all they can respond with is beeps.

Index Moths will try to guide lost readers in the Infinite Library back to the Information Desk. They are successful approximately 75% of the time. They will also try to help you find a book you're looking for, and can do so by name or catalog number, though have similar success rates.

Index Moth Files can be up to 150 moths in a single shelf. Spooking a File triggers an Catalog Cascade, where the panicking Index Moths will rapidly try to reshelve books nearby, even to shelves they don't belong to.

Index Moths will clear out other moths from areas they shouldn't be in. For reasons that are currently not known, other moths respond to the beeps by leaving the area. Attempts to reproduce this with a barcode scanner on a drone have been unsuccessful.

Index Moths can bite.
